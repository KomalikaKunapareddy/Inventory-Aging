# Inventory-Aging
You have been given the product ids, product name, product category unit price, and quantity of ‘SparkleMart’. As an analyst you have been asked to prepare the inventory aging report that provides insights into the duration it takes for each inventory item to deplete, allowing them to easily categorize products as stagnant based on the analysis of this time period. 
SparkleMart applies varying profit margins to different categories of products. The Dairy category yields a profit margin of 15% on the cost price, Condiments category has a profit margin of 32% on the cost price, Canned Goods category has a profit margin of 28% on the cost price, Snacks category has a profit margin of 25% on the cost price, and the Beverages category has a profit margin of 30%, Produce category has a profit margin of 20% and grains category has a profit margin of 22%.
Due to heavy losses incurred from expired products, management of “SparkleMart” has decided to take measures to prevent further losses. As a part of their strategy, they have decided to offer discounts on products that are approaching their expiration date. 
Management has made the decision to classify the list of products based on their respective due times, in order to assess the condition and age of the inventories. They have established a set of categories to facilitate discount decisions that are informed by the age of the inventories. In case Expiration date is passed then days to be taken as Zero.
